## Overview
This project is another one of my many projects that I'm currently doing in order to level up my frontend development skill.
the project is a landing page of clipboard and the reason why I choose this projct was because I wanted to see how famialy I am with the plain HTML and CSS and during the process of completing this project I have really realized that I still need more practicce to level up.s
### The challenge
Although this project did not seem that hard in the initail phase but as I delve more into it I soon realized that it was harder than I initially thought expecially with the footer that I had to make the width the full zise of any device it is been view from. I did not find it hard implement in the mobile device but it took me me a while to make the same thing happed in the desktop view.
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
The first thing I always do when I'm to work on a project is to write the HTML before looking at the CSS, doing so alway some how lowers my burden and give me more free time to think about how to tarkle the CSS.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned a lot from this particular project, especial when I got stack with the footer issue. I have realized that I have to google thing more often than I really think I have to and it gave me the chance to used the resources out there and also appreciate others point of view.

### Continued development

In my future learning journey I want to learn more on Grid and see how combining it with the flexbox can help facilitate my projects and I also intend to learn react and more libraries as the journey of web development never ends, this way I can be equipt with the necesary skills that I need to succeed in the tech niche.
